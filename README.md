## About Cher's Closet

Cher's Closet is an outfit planning app that was inspired by the 1995 movie Clueless. It is built with a React front end and a Rails backend, using ActiveStorage as a way to upload and save images.

In Cher's Closet users can upload clothing items to their closet, create new outfits out of many clothing items and then edit or delete items and outfits. There is also a filter function to filter items in your closet by category. This allows users to find items quickly, instead of clicking endlessly through the carousel.

You can view the frontend of the code [here](https://github.com/lh62594/chers-closet-frontend).
